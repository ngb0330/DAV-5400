    "There are 3 different tasks that I set out to accomplish using this API:\n",
    "1. Search for a specific movie to see whether there are reviews for that movie.\n",
    "2. Search for a specific reviewer to see whether there are any reviews by that reviewer.\n",
    "3. Find the 5 most recent movies that were critics picks in the NYT. \n",

    "In order to accomplish these tasks, I used three Python libraries:\n",
